, is an innovative AI-driven crypto co-pilot designed to simplify complex blockchain interactions for users of all experience levels. By leveraging natural language processing and large language models, HeyElsa allows individuals to execute DeFi operations—such as swapping tokens, bridging assets, staking, lending, and managing portfolios—through simple text or voice commands. For instance, users can prompt Elsa with instructions like "Bridge ETH from Arbitrum to Base" or "Swap $50 for ETH," and the AI handles wallet routing, gas optimization, risk checks, and on-chain execution seamlessly. This intent-based approach abstracts away the technical hurdles of multi-chain environments, making crypto more accessible without requiring deep technical knowledge.
