HeyElsa's relationship with Base, an Ethereum Layer 2 network developed by Coinbase, is particularly strong and symbiotic. Base provides low-cost, high-speed transactions, which align perfectly with HeyElsa's goal of simplifying on-chain actions. Users frequently interact with Base through Elsa for tasks like bridging funds, executing swaps, and participating in DeFi yield strategies, with the platform processing significant daily transaction volumes on the networkâ€”around 30,000 transactions and $2 million in volume as of late 2025.

 HeyElsa's X posts often highlight Base-specific features, such as giveaways sending USDC directly on Base or prompts for bridging to the network, underscoring its role as a preferred ecosystem for demonstrations and user engagement. 

This connection is deepened by direct backing from the Base Ecosystem Fund, part of Coinbase Ventures, which participated in HeyElsa's $3 million pre-seed and seed funding round in June 2025, led by M31 Capital.
